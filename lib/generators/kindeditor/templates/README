The generator had installed kindeditor to your application's public path:

  1. If you want to use kindeditor,you can add kindeditor helper to layout,and add a id "kindeditor" to your textarea:
     For example:
     in application.html.erb 
      <%=kindeditor_javacript_include_tag%>
    
     in _form.html.erb
      <%= f.text_area :body,:id => "kindeditor" %>

  2. Because the kindeditor use paperclip to upload image,so make sure your Gemfile have add paperclip.
     For example:

       gem 'paperclip'

  3. If you want to modify the kindeditor config,you can find it in public/kindeditor/kindeditor_config.js:
